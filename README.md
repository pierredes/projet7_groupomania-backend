how to install the project on your machine :

1/ clone the repository on your machine
2/ type "npm install" to install the project
3/ create a new mysql database (name it as you want)
4/ change .envexample to .env
5/ change all variable in .env (works with mysql so be careful of entering mysql data configuration) 



you can now start the server, enter 'npm start' to launch it (or nodemon server.js if you want to change some files)
